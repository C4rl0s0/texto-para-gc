Nintendo began developing the GameCube in 1998 after entering a partnership with ArtX to design 
a graphics processing unit. The console was formally announced under the codename "Dolphin" the following year, 
and was released in 2001 as the GameCube. It is Nintendo's first console to use its own optical discs 
instead of ROM cartridges, supplemented by writable memory cards for saved games. Unlike its competitors, 
it is solely focused on gaming and does not play mass media like DVD or CD.
