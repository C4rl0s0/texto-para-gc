According to kaiju lore, Godzilla is a prehistoric monster, but most fans would agree that it was born in 
August 1945, when US atomic bombs detonated over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing more 
than 150,000 people. "It's important for us to remember that Japan is the only nation on Earth to have 
directly suffered an atomic bombardment," Steven Sloss, a leading kaiju scholar, tells the BBC. 
"That's why, with what it explores, Godzilla is a film that only Japan could have made."
